# CITS3403_Cartographers
CITS3403 Project - Josh Wyatt (jwyatt, 22601159) &amp; Joo Kai Tay (Bsubs)

# Link to Deployed Website:
https://afternoon-castle-17520.herokuapp.com/

## Steps to Deploy:
1. Before starting, ensure you have the Heroku CLI installed, available here: https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe
2. Checkout main and pull all changes
3. Open Git Bash and `cd` your way to your local CITS3403_Cartographers files
4. Use `git push heroku main`
5. Use `heroku ps:scale web=1`, it should say "Scaling dynos... done, now running web at 1:Free"
6. Use `heroku open` and confirm the website is running, if it is broken then use `heroku logs` and figure out what caused the crash

# Rough Timeline:

**Weeks 5 to 7 (28/03 - 17/04)**: Sprint 1 (3 weeks, Get prototype up and deployed online that has all functionality except account creation and login - Spend few days testing to identify bugs and ways to improve)

**Weeks 8 to 10 (18/04 - 08/05)**: Sprint 2 (3 weeks, CONFIRM WHAT ELSE WE MUST DO TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT, Iterate on prototype and add user creation and login functionality and any other functionality we wish to add, add unit tests - Spend few days testing to identify bugs and ways to improve)

**Weeks 11 to 12 (09/05-22/05)**: Sprint 3 (2 weeks, Iterate on prototype and clean up any bugs - This process will involve lots of testing, Update readme to meet the requirements specified on the project page)

**Week 13 (23/05): Project Due 12pm**

# Start-of-Sprint Steps:
1. Remember to consider big picture / goal
2. Reflect on progress so far, estimates for remaining work, and decide if we should keep or drop any user stories that weren’t completed in the previous sprint
3. Decide on user stories for the current sprint (achievable goals written from the perspective of the user, not too large so that we can test sooner rather than later) and decide on their relative priorities
4. Decide on acceptance criteria for the user stories and estimate the time required to implement (specific, broken down into actionable tasks that culminate to satisfy a user story)
5. Decide what acceptance criteria we will work towards between this meeting and the next meeting

# Meeting-During-Sprint Steps:
1. Discuss progress on assigned acceptance criteria, any blockers, and what acceptance criteria we will each progress next
2. Re-evaluate estimates as necessary and decide if we should keep or drop acceptance criteria that we don’t think are achievable

# End-of-Sprint Steps (Same time as Start-of-Sprint Steps for Sprint 2 and 3):
1. Review everything we completed this sprint
2. Discuss what went well this sprint, what went poorly, and how we can improve processes to ensure this project is a success

# Development Agreement
1. We will stick to the HTML/CSS style guidelines here: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/laboratories/htmlcssguide.html
2. We will each work on branches off of main (could be separate, though we could work on the same branch if necessary). We can merge when it seems appropriate via pull request but our code must be code reviewed before it is merged - this will be an opportunity for learning and catching mistakes 
3. We will have meetings once a week to ensure we don’t stay blocked on tasks and ensure we are doing continual work

# CITS3403 Project Marking Criteria
https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/projects/Project2Criterion.pdf
