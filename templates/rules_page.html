                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <em>
                <p>
                    Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. 
                    As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for 
                    the Kindgom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she 
                    prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their 
                    outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reclaim the greatest share of the queen's desired lands and you will be declared the 
                    greatest cartographer in the kingdom!
                </p>
                </em>
                <br>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In Cartographers, your goal is to earn as many points as you can by the time <b>three</b> seasons have passed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>How To Play</h3>
                <p>
                    Each season you will place terrain pieces on the map until there are no pieces remaining this season, at which point the score card 
                    for the season is scored. The number of pieces remaining this season is shown beneath the score card description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before placing your terrain piece you can move it around using the arrow keys or the buttons on the botton-left side of the screen. You can 
                    rotate the piece with 'r', flip the piece with 'f', change the piece's type with 't', and place the piece with 'Enter' - or you can do these 
                    actions by using the buttons on the bottom-right side of the screen. Changing a piece's type will either change it's shape and cause it to grant you a 
                    coin when placed (indicated on the bar along the bottom of the screen), or change it's terrain type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When placing a terrain piece it <b>cannot overlap</b> any filled spaces or the edges of the map. The piece does not have to be 
                    placed adjacent to any pieces previously placed on the map. The piece can be rotated, flipped, and/or have it's type changed as needed until it is 
                    placed on the map. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are seven terrain types in Cartographers: <b><span style="color:green">Forests (green)</span>, <span style="color:red">Villages (red)</span>, 
                    <span style="color:yellow; text-shadow: 0px 0px 6px black;">Farms (yellow)</span>, <span style="color:blue">Rivers (blue)</span>, 
                    <span style="color:black">Abysses (black)</span>, <span style="color:brown">Mountains (brown and </span> <span style="color:grey">grey)</span>,</b> and 
                    <b><span style="color:purple">Monsters (purple)</span></b>.
                    You may also see <b><span style="color:orange">orange</span></b> spaces. These occur where your current terrain piece is overlapping with a filled space on the map. 
                    A space is filled if it contains any of the seven terrain types (including monsters!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The starting board will have two mountains and three abysses randomly placed on it. Each mountain will have four empty, cardinally adjacent spaces. If you 
                    surround a mountain space by filling all four adjacent spaces then you will "claim" the mountain and gain a <b>coin</b> (more on these further down) - this will 
                    cause the mountain to turn grey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The terrain pieces you place will only consist of the forest, village, farm, and river terrain types.  You will want to place these pieces in a way that maximises the points you  
                    gain from your score cards. Monster spaces will appear in random locations whenever an <b>ambush</b> occurs. Ambushes are counted in the number of terrain pieces remaining
                    this season. Whether an ambush will occur during a given season is random - you may have three ambushes throughout the game, or you may have none.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Scoring</h3>
                <p>
                    At the end of each season you will earn or lose points from several sources: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will <b>gain</b> points based on the <b>score card(s)</b> corresponding to the season. Seasons 1 and 2 will only have a single score card, and season 3 will
                    have two score cards. Score cards are colour-coded to match the terrain type they score. Each game will have one score card for villages, 
                    one for forests, one for farms and rivers, and one for piece placement. The piece placement score card is always scored at the end 
                    of the third season (alongside another score card), and the other score cards will have a random order. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When scoring, adjacency is only determined cardinally, and a group of connected spaces that all have the same terrain type is called a cluster 
                    (these can be any size, including just one space).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will <b>gain</b> points equal to the number of <b>coins</b> you currently have. Coins persist from season to season so a coin earned during the first 
                    season will score you three points throughout the course of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will <b>lose</b> points for every empty space that is cardinally adjacent to at least one <b>monster space</b> on the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it for the rules! Now go and play some games!
